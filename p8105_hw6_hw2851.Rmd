# Problem 1 

read and clean data
```{r, include=FALSE}
birth_weight_df = 
  read_csv("./birthweight.csv")%>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(
   babysex = recode_factor(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female"),
    frace = recode_factor(frace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other", "9" = "Unkown"),
    mrace = recode_factor(mrace, "1" = "White", "2" = "Black", "3" = "Asian", "4" = "Puerto Rican", "8" = "Other"),
    malform = recode_factor(malform, "0" = "absent", "1" = "present")
  )

birth_weight_df
```

After cleaning the data , we have seen variable "pnumsga" and "pnumlbw" are all 0 across the dataset, and variable "parity"and "malform" have less than five values included, so we exclude those variables and take the others as the predictors.

```{r, include=FALSE}
birth_weight_df %>%
  select()
  
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
